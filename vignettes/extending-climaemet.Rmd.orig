**climaemet** provides several functions for accessing a selection of endpoints of the [AEMET API tool](https://opendata.aemet.es/dist/index.html?). However, this package does not cover in full all the capabilities of the API.

For that reason, we provide the `get_data_aemet()` function, that allows to access any API endpoint freely. The drawback is that the user would need to handle the results by him/herself.

```{r setup}
library(climaemet)
```

## Example: Normalized text

Some API endpoints, as **predicciones-normalizadas-texto**, provides the results as plain text on natural language. These results are not parsed by **climaemet**, but can be retrieved as this:

```{r text}

# endpoint, today forecast

today <- "/api/prediccion/nacional/hoy"

# Metadata
knitr::kable(get_metadata_aemet(today))

# Data
pred_today <- get_data_aemet(today)

```

```{r, results='asis', comment=''}

# Produce a result

clean <- gsub("\r", "\n", pred_today, fixed = TRUE)
clean <- gsub("\n\n\n", "\n", clean, fixed = TRUE)

cat(paste("---\n\n", clean, "\n---"))

```

## Example: Maps

AEMET also provides map data, usually on `image/gif` format. One way to get this kind of data is as follows:

```{r maps, fig.cap="Example: Surface analysis map provided by AEMET"}

# Endpoint of a map
a_map <- "/api/mapasygraficos/analisis"

# Metadata
knitr::kable(get_metadata_aemet(a_map))

the_map <- get_data_aemet(a_map)


# Write as gif and include it
giffile <- "example-gif.gif"
writeBin(the_map, giffile)

# Display on the vignette
knitr::include_graphics(giffile)

```
