## R Climate AEMET Tools

#### Manuel Pizarro (http://www.ipe.csic.es)


## Description

The goal of **climaemet** is to serve as an interface to download the climatic data of the Spanish Meteorological Agency (AEMET) directly from R using their API (https://opendata.aemet.es/) and create scientific graphs (climate charts, trend analysis of climate time series, temperature and precipitation anomalies maps, "warming stripes" graphics, climatograms, etc.).

## AEMET Open Data

AEMET OpenData is a REST API developed by AEMET that allows the dissemination and reuse of the Agency's meteorological and climatological information. To see more details visit: https://opendata.aemet.es/centrodedescargas/inicio

## License for the original data

Information prepared by the Spanish Meteorological Agency (Â© AEMET). You can read about it here (in spanish): http://www.aemet.es/es/nota_legal

A summary for the usage of the data could be interpreted as:

People can use freely this data. You should mention AEMET as the collector of the original data in every situation except if you are using this data privately and individually. AEMET makes no warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of the data. All data are provided on an "as is" basis. AEMET is not responsible for any damage or loss derived from the interpretation or use of this data.

## Installation

You can install the released version of **climaemet** from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("climaemet")
```

## Requirements

To be able to download data from AEMET you will need a free API key which you can get at https://opendata.aemet.es/centrodedescargas/obtencionAPIKey

```r
library(climaemet)

## Get api key from AEMET
browseURL("https://opendata.aemet.es/centrodedescargas/obtencionAPIKey")

## Use this function to register your API Key temporarly or permanently
aemet_api_key("<MY API KEY>")

```

## Examples

These are basic examples to obtain data from the AEMET Open Data API:

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(climaemet)
```

## Now **climaemet** is tidy...

From `v1.0.0` onward, **climaemet** provides its results in [tibble
format](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/). Also, the functions try to
guess the correct format of the fields (i.e. something as a Date/Hour now is an hour, numbers are parsed as double, etc.).

```{r tibble}
# See a tibble in action

aemet_last_obs("9434")

```

The package provides several functions to access the data of the API. Here you can find some examples:

```{r api}

## Get AEMET stations
stations <- aemet_stations() # Need to have the API Key registered

knitr::kable(head(stations))

station <- "9434" # Zaragoza Aeropuerto

## Get last observation values for a station
data_observation <- aemet_last_obs(station)

knitr::kable(head(data_observation))

## Get daily/annual climatology values for a station
data_daily <-
  aemet_daily_clim(station, start = "2020-01-01", end = "2020-12-31")

knitr::kable(head(data_daily))


## Get monthly/annual climatology values for a station
data_monthly <- aemet_monthly_clim(station, year = 2000)
knitr::kable(head(data_monthly))


## Get recorded extreme values of temperature for a station
data_extremes <- aemet_extremes_clim(station, parameter = "T")
knitr::kable(head(data_extremes))
```

We can also draw a "warming stripes" graph with the downloaded data from a 
weather station. These functions returns `ggplot2` plots:

```{r stripes, fig.asp=0.7}

# Plot a climate stripes graph for a period of years for a station
climatestripes_station("9434", start = 1980, end = 2020)

```

Furthermore, we can draw the well-known Walter & Lieth climatic diagram for a weather station and over a specified period of time:

```{r climatogram, fig.asp=0.7}
# Plot of a Walter & Lieth climatic diagram (normal climatology values) for a station
climatogram_normal("9434", labels = "en")
```

Additionally, we may be interested in drawing the wind speed and direction over a period of time for the data downloaded from a weather station.:

```{r windrose, fig.asp=0.7}

# Plot a windrose showing the wind speed and direction for a station over a days period.
windrose_days(
  "9434",
  start = "2010-01-01",
  end = "2020-12-31",
  n_speeds = 5,
  speed_cuts = c(2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, 15)
)
```

## ... and spatial!

Another major change in `v1.0.0` is the ability of return information on 
spatial `sf` format, using `return_sf = TRUE`. The coordinate reference system (CRS) used is **EPSG 4326**, that correspond to the **World Geodetic System (WGS)** and return coordinates in latitude/longitude (unprojected coordinates): 

```{r spatial}

# You would need to install `sf` if not installed yet
# run install.packages("sf") for installation

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
all_stations <- aemet_last_obs(return_sf = TRUE)
# Last hour
all_last <-
  all_stations %>% filter(fint == all_stations[["fint"]][1])

ggplot(all_last) +
  geom_sf(aes(col = ta, stroke = 0), shape = 19, size = 2) +
  labs(col = "Max temp.") +
  scale_colour_gradientn(colours = hcl.colors(5, "RdBu", rev = TRUE)) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(panel.border = element_blank())

```
